----- Priority 3
	
	Make floaty icons/text for when zombies are killed or perhaps for when humans are killed/converted!

	Speed up the generator web worker by not copying a billion element array

	Add a preview grid to evolution menu so player can see


----- Priority 5

	Make values for defining land color smoothly shift from one data square to the other - i.e. as it moves left 1.00,0.00 0.75,0.25 0.50,0.50 0.25,0.75 for 4x4 texture pixels per data, same for down

	Fix land being at zero moisture for horse latitudes, no mixing or mixing of identically dry squares or something

	WHEN MOVING TO SERVER:  make climate data image load from file, make UI html load from files, make simulator modules load from files











Stirling's approximation and probability distribution - INTEGRAL OF (2/sqrt(2*pi*100))*e^(-x^2/(2*100)) where 100 is # steps, x is probability of landing on that spot

prob = 1-erf(n/sqrt(2N)) where N is steps and n is where you want to end up going past
