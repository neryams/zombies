Make zombies move based on true distance and with probability distribution

Stirling's approximation and probability distribution - INTEGRAL OF (2/sqrt(2*pi*100))*e^(-x^2/(2*100)) where 100 is # steps, x is probability of landing on that spot

prob = 1-erf(n/sqrt(2N)) where N is steps and n is where you want to end up going past

def erf(x):
    # save the sign of x
    sign = 1 if x >= 0 else -1
    x = abs(x)

    # constants
    a1 =  0.254829592
    a2 = -0.284496736

    a4 = -1.453152027

    p  =  0.3275911

    # A&S formula 7.1.26
    t = 1.0/(1.0 + p*x)

Add a preview grid to evolution menu so player can see

Add functionality to genes to affect other adjacent genes

Add interface in UI to display news in the ticker and popup warnings/notifications (like research started!)

Add tutorial function that overlays graphics and removes them on triggers



Make values for defining land color smoothly shift from one data square to the other - i.e. as it moves left 1.00,0.00 0.75,0.25 0.50,0.50 0.25,0.75 for 4x4 texture pixels per data, same for down

Fix land being at zero moisture for horse latitudes, no mixing or mixing of identically dry squares or something

WHEN MOVING TO SERVER:  make climate data image load from file, make UI html load from files, make simulator modules load from files
