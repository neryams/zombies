----- Priority 1


----- Priority 2

	Make resistance kill zombies. Also resistance is too strong right now.

	Button for toggling mouseover debug in console

	Add human strongholds in later stages of panic.


----- Priority 3
	
	Make floaty icons/text for when zombies are killed or perhaps for when humans are killed/converted!
		-> Also only show the icons above a threshold of whatever is happening, like LoL healing

	Button for clicking on a square to debug it

	Add functionality to genes to affect other adjacent genes

	Add tutorial function that overlays graphics and removes them on triggers


----- Priority 4

	Adjust population based on latitude (points closer to poles have less area per point)

	Try to change the __proto__ in the webworker copy to something a bit less ghetto

	Speed up the generator web worker by not copying a billion element array

	Add a preview grid to evolution menu so player can see


----- Priority 5

	Make values for defining land color smoothly shift from one data square to the other - i.e. as it moves left 1.00,0.00 0.75,0.25 0.50,0.50 0.25,0.75 for 4x4 texture pixels per data, same for down

	Fix land being at zero moisture for horse latitudes, no mixing or mixing of identically dry squares or something

	Combine bars near the poles so that bars are approximately evenly distributed











Stirling's approximation and probability distribution - INTEGRAL OF (2/sqrt(2*pi*100))*e^(-x^2/(2*100)) where 100 is # steps, x is probability of landing on that spot

prob = 1-erf(n/sqrt(2N)) where N is steps and n is where you want to end up going past
